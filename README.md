# Prepplate

I built and ran this project on Visual Studio Code and used an android emulator to test and run my app. The app includes many packages some from react and node. I follow guides to setup a react native project. 

Copying and pasting code should work after installing neccessary packages. To start the backend server you must open a terminal and run the command cd ReactNative/NewIdea/backend to enter the backend project directory and then run the command node server.js and the terminal should give a response stating the server is running

after starting the server you must open another terminal and enter the project directory by running cd ReactNative/NewIdea and then running the command npx expo start. the project should run and the prompt press a in the terminal to open the project on the andorid.

The app works on ios and Android but also the web(although the web version isnt very well refined) The app can be ran on your phone by downloading the expo go app and scanning the QR code. The server and app have to be running i recommend running npx expo start --lan and ensuring you are on the same wifi for both devices. After scanning the Qr it takes you to the browser click expo go and the app should run.
